opencv3: CUDA is required.To use this formula with NVIDIA graphics cards you will need to
download and install the CUDA drivers and tools from nvidia.com.

    https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

Select "Mac OS" as the Operating System and then select the
'Developer Drivers for MacOS' package.
You will also need to download and install the 'CUDA Toolkit' package.

The `nvcc` has to be in your PATH then (which is normally the case).
